# searching-follow-backs
List people who are not following back on Instagram
This allows you to easily find people who are not following you back or whom you are not following back.

By running this in Visual Studio Code or any similar IDE and following the terminal instructions, download your data from Instagram's Account Center.
Extract the downloaded zip file and navigate to the followers_and_following folder. Drag and drop the followers_1.html and following.html files from this folder.
This will create a .txt file in the followers_and_following folder listing the respective usernames.
